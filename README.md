# Introduction

Welcome to BaushaOS, a small project aimed at getting me to learn more about programming philosophies and problem solving. It includes a hardware userspace for the OS built on MicroPython, a VM (not very similar to hardware) for the OS, driver (hardware) and app support, a markov chain bot, and a custom compiler. The end goal is to either get the compiler onto LLVM or get the OS on the Linux Kernel.

# Hardware

The hardware part of this project is a userpsace program built on top of the MicroPython firmware for the Pi Pico 2W, which doubles as a kernel for it. It's all consolidated into one file, making it monolithic, but is relatively clearly sectioned, so it's very readable in terms of code structure.

The file contains four sections: the shell/REPL, the IDE, the markov chain bot, and the tailored custom language compiler.
