# Introduction

Welcome to BaushaOS, a small project aimed at getting me to learn more about programming philosophies and problem solving. It includes a hardware userspace for the OS built on MicroPython, a VM (not very similar to hardware) for the OS, driver (hardware) and app support, a markov chain bot, and a custom compiler. The end goal is to either get the compiler onto LLVM or get the OS on the Linux Kernel.
